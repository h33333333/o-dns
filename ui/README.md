# A simple React dashboard

This is a simple Web UI dashboard written using React.

It's mobile-frendly and provides an easy-to-use interface for configuring and monitoring the DNS server.

> Before running or building the UI, set the `VITE_API_SERVER_URL` env var in `.env` to point to your `o-dns` server instance.

## Running the UI

This project uses *Vite*, so you can easily run the UI for testing using the `pnpm dev` command

## Building the UI for production

Use the `pnpm build`command to build the project for production.

You can then use `pnpm preview` to easily run the built project with *Vite*.
